## Design choises
### Visuals
Since math is a bit alien to some people, I decided to give the scene a space vibe. I set the background as space.
I gave the floor a weird concrete texture and I made the monolithic shape showing the numbers a hairy texture to make it extra weird.
### Sound
I used some of my own ambient music to reflect the vast emptiness of space.
I recorded the sound of a switch and added a reverb to it with a long tail to give it a spacey vibe.
